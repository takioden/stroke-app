🧠 Stroke Prediction App

A Machine Learning web application built with Streamlit to predict the risk of stroke based on patient characteristics.
This app uses a trained Logistic Regression model along with a StandardScaler and one-hot encoded features.

💡 Purpose

This app provides a simple and interactive way to demonstrate how machine learning can be used for early stroke risk screening.
⚠️ Not for medical diagnosis. Consult healthcare professionals for clinical decisions.
